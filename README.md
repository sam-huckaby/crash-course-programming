# Crash Course Programming

## Are You Ready?

I want to teach you how to program computers.

In today's day and age it has never been easier to enter the world of computer programming. Pretty much every adult has a computer that is capable of writing some kind of computer code, even if it's an old laptop that you've had forever.

All you need is a desire to learn and a willingness to keep trying when you don't get it right away. There is no magic bullet. You will get frustrated - that's true no matter what you're learning. If you're willing to take on this challenge, then this course will help guide you.

## Cost

This course is completely free. There's no pro plan, there's no locked features, there's no money to be made. If you want to pay for a more polished and refined course, here are several I recommend:
- Fireship tutorials
- better.dev
- I'll add more later

## Prerequisites

In order to be successful in this course, you will only need a couple things:

**A Computer** - It is possible to write code on smart phones and tablets, but it is not intuitive and is not recommended. You should have either a laptop or a desktop computer running MacOS, Linux, or Windows. Windows will be slightly more work, because it is not as "commandline friendly", but it will do the trick.

**A Desire to Learn** - I can't give you this, and you can't buy it. If you don't want to learn how to write code, then don't! It's that simple. There is no guarantee that you will finish this course and get a better paying job or even a job at all. You have to learn to enjoy coding, before you can become really good at it (my opinion).

**An Internet Connection (Sometimes)** - Several pieces of the course interact with videos or outside resources, so having access to the internet is pretty important. The computer you use does not necessarily need to have an internet connection, but you will need some way to access it for content. You will need to get this repo onto your programming computer one way or another, and having access to the internet on you programming computer will be the easiest way to do that.

**That's It.**

You don't need anything else. If you have those three things, you are ready to begin.

## Expectations

This course will plot a rough course through topics that you would normally be taught at a university in a computer science program. However, this course is **NOT** accredited. You cannot say you have a degree after completing this course, people _will_ laugh at you.

Each module is a new language or skill. Each module will attempt to teach you what you need to know to put that language or skill into immediate use. Each module will also feature some waypoints that check to make sure you are still headed in the right direction. Much like a sailer will check the stars to see that they are still headed towards... wherever they're going... you will have opportunities to check that you actually understood what you just learned. If you cheat or skip over these, you only hurt yourself, no one else.

This course is Open Source. If you see something wrong or something that could be improved, it would be awesome if you suggested a fix, or even better, if you put in a PR with the change you would like to see. Learning to program can be daunting, but together, we can make it accessible to every single person, no matter what their life is like or what point in that life they are at.

**Together, we can teach the world to code**
