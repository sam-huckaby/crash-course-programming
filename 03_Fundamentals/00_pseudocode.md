# Pseudocode
Pseudocode is a way of writing programs or algorithms in plain english that can later be converted into a programming language.
This is an incredibly helpful skill to have, because it will help you break down problems into more manageable pieces and helps make challenges further down the line more obvious.

## Writing Pseudocode
**There is no right way to write pseudocode** Everyone has their own special way of doing it, and that is perfectly fine. What's important is that you have a style that makes sense
to you, and can be conveyed quickly and easily to others. In this lesson, we'll break down a simple pseudocode "syntax" (way of writing) that you can use or adapt as needed.

### Variables
